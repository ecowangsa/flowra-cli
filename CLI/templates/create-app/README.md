# Flowra App

This project was generated by Flowra CLI. It ships with a modular HTTP server, a basic users module, and a minimal test suite so you can start building immediately.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm (or yarn/pnpm)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To run the production-style server:

```bash
npm start
```

For a smoke test that starts and exits automatically:

```bash
npm start -- --once
```

## Environment

Copy the example environment file and adjust database credentials as needed:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The default configuration expects MySQL and reads values from the `DB_*` variables in `.env`.

## Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Notes

- The `flowra` CLI is installed as a dev dependency, so npm scripts can call it directly.
- Run `flowra --help` to see available commands inside the project.
